Description

This project predicts student exam scores based on the number of hours spent studying using a simple linear regression model. The model is trained on a dataset containing study hours and corresponding scores. It also provides an interactive feature where users can input their study hours to receive a predicted exam score.

Features

Linear regression model to predict exam scores from study hours.

Model evaluation using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Interactive prediction where users can input their study hours to get a predicted score.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation.

NumPy: For numerical calculations.

Scikit-learn: To implement linear regression.

Matplotlib (optional): For visualizing the results (if you choose to add this).
