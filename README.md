# Student-Study-Hours-Prediction
This project uses linear regression to predict student exam scores based on study hours. It evaluates model performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Additionally, users can input their study hours to get a predicted score. The model is trained on a dataset of study hours and corresponding scores (student.xlsx).
